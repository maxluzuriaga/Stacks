Stacks
======

An unfinished iOS project, for posterity. This project was written during the iOS 5 beta, with the idea of creating and studying from flash cards, for tests and quizzes. iCloud syncing was used to synchronize a Core Data database with the cloud, which at the time was extremely difficult, since iCloud was a new technology, and it didn't fully support Core Data (it still doesn't, but it's gotten better).

A possible future version of this app would remove the iCloud syncing functionality, and instead use a dedicated server to store and share stacks of flascards.
